# next-word-prediction

This project implements a Next Word Prediction system using TensorFlow and LSTM in Google Colab. It trains an LSTM model to predict the next word in a sequence based on input text data. The key steps are:

Preprocess Data: Convert the text into sequences for training.
Train Model: Use the preprocessed data to train an LSTM model.
Predict Next Word: After training, the model predicts the next word from an input sequence.
